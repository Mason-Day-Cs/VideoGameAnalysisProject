# VideoGameAnalysisProject

This project explores global video game sales data to identify trends across genres, platforms, publishers, and years.  
The goal is to practice data analysis using Excel (pivot tables, charts, and dashboards) and present clear business insights.  

## Tools Used
- **Excel / Google Sheets** → pivot tables, charts, dashboards  
- **GitHub** → version control & portfolio hosting  
- **Kaggle Dataset (VGChartz)** → [Video Game Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)
